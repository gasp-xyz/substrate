/// # Block production logic
///
/// In origin substrate impl there are three limits, as soon one of them is exceeded block
/// producation is finalized and block is broadcastet:
/// - block size limit
/// - block weight limit (sum of weights of all transactions)
/// - block execution time limit (actual execution time of)
///
///
/// In mangata transaction included into block `N` is executed in block `N+1` because of
/// shuffling(VER prevention) mechanism.
///
/// We want to avoid situation where block would by filled with
/// txs to that point that in the following block there would be no space left for inclusion of
/// following txs
///
/// imagine that we have X time for tx processing in every block.
/// **In block `N+1` ther would no room for any transaction to be included because execution of
/// previous block will exceed block limits.**

/// # Block construction vs block execution
/// Block construction & block execution(broadcasted block is executed by every network participant)
/// are two distinct logical flows that results with exactly the same state.
/// There is number of differences, some of them are:
/// - block construction process happens in native/host code, all interactions with storage happens
/// through runtime api, while block execution happens entirely at runtime. Native code can access
/// runtime while runtime has no access to native code (rocksdb database, reversable txs etc)
/// - during block production txs are fetched from StorageQeueu one by one inside revertable
/// transaction. When slot limits are reached the most recent tx (that exceeds the limit) is brought
/// back to into the queue by reverting last transaction that dequeues single tx. None of that
/// happens during block execution, number of txs that should be fetched is already set and passed
/// in block header (by block builder)
/// - during block production seed is generated by siging previous block seed using collator private
/// key while during execution new seed is only validated by using previous seed & collator public
/// key.
/// - during block production txs included into the block **from transaction
/// pool** are actually executed (to check if txs will not exceed block execution time limit) but
/// eventually all of them are reverted because they are meant to be executed in following block
/// (after shuffling). During block execution these txs are not executed(they will be in following
/// block but we still consider if included txs will fit into single block) because at runtime its
/// not possible to revert changes made by particular transaction
///
